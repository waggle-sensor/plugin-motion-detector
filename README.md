# General Purpose Motion Detector

This is a general purpose motion detection plugin that incorporates various online moving object detectors, which can be paired with object trackers.

### Object Detectors:
* Background Subtraction (naive, Gaussian Mixture, and K-Nearest Neighbors methods)
	* [[reference paper]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865505003521)
* Farneb√§ck's Dense Optical Flow Method (recommended detector):
	* [[reference paper]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225138825_Two-Frame_Motion_Estimation_Based_on_Polynomial_Expansion)

### Object Trackers:
* Naive Exponential Moving Average Tracker

## Dependencies
